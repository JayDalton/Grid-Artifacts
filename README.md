## Grid Artifacts Elimination in Computed Radiographic Images

This project tries to implement *A new stationary gridline artifact suppression method based on the 2D discrete wavelet transform* for given DICOM files. It's article can be found under [ResearchGate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274399694_A_new_stationary_gridline_artifact_suppression_method_based_on_the_2D_discrete_wavelet_transform).

### Possible Functionality

Two given interfaces allowing Commandline based 

### Possible Technologies

+ C++ / WinRT based UWP Application for Windows 10
+ WPF based dialog description with coroutines
+ Using Win2D for rendering images and charts 
+ Using DCMTK for reading and writing DICOM file format
+ Using OpenCV for manipulating complex image informations
+ applying given suppression methods
